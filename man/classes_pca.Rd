\title{PCA plot visualising pathway-based classification of samples in a dataset}
\usage{
classes_pca(norm_data, predicted_labels_df, pathway = "Pathway Activity")
}
\arguments{
\item{norm_data}{A (logCPM) normalized gene expression data
matrix, with row names consisting of the HUGO gene symbols and column names
corresponding to the name / ID of each sample in the dataset}

\item{predicted_labels_df}{A data frame containing the pathway
activity labels predicted by classification algorithm for each sample in the
dataset. The first column is called "sample" which contains the sample names
in the data set and the second column is called "class" containing the
corresponding predicted pathway activity of the sample.}

\item{pathway}{The pathway name used in the title of the plot, default is
a placeholder "Pathway Activity".}
}
\description{
This function generates a PCA plot showing the clustering of
samples in the normalised expression data set, coloured by predicted pathway
activity labels: active (green), inactive (orange) and uncertain (blue). An
ideal pathway-based classification would generate a PCA plot showing tight
clustering of samples in each activity class and less overlap between classes.
