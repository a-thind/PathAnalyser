Description: PathAnalyser provides an assessment of molecular pathway
    activity in transcriptomic datasets. The classification algorithm
    employed by PathAnalyser implements Gene GSVA to classify samples in a
    transcriptomic dataset by pathway activity using a gene signature.
    Currently, the package provides built-in data for assessment of ER &
    HER2 pathway activity in breast cancer transcriptomic datasets,
    however the PathAnalyser functionality could also be applied to gene
    signatures and/or transcriptomic datasets in non-oncological contexts.
